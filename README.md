# ExcelTranslationProject
The program reads from an Excel file in Chinese and translate with SYSTRAN/Google/DeepL translator into English (can be German, French or any other major languague) and write the translation into an excel file. Currently, the Chinese source file have 11 or 12 columns and hundreds or thousands of rows. Some cells can be empty, have numeric values or have upto 1000 Chinese letters which cannot be translated with Google (which allows upto 430 Chinese letters), but with SYSTRAN (which allows upto 2000 Chinese letters) can be translated and more accurate than Google or DeepL translate and much batter than Google Sheet Translation. Google Translate is very speedy compared to other translators and more proper to use when the size of cells are not bigger than 430 Chinese letters. SYTRAN has much better accuracy than the others and it the tool to go for manual translation. For Example: 特克斯县 (with Google or DeepL): Turks county (wrong); 克斯县 (with SYSTRAN): Tekes county(correct).
